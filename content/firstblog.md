Having a decade of design experience, I have always been working to make things pretty and usable. And I'm still working on it. I never had the opportunity to go beyond the screens. Because I was too comfortable in that zone but it doesn't look more comfortable now.

I like to equip myself with a different type of thinking and embrace new challenges. That is when I got to know about systems thinking.

## What is System Thinking?

System thinking is an approach that considers the entire system as a  whole, rather than its individual parts or components. It is a way of understanding how different parts of a system interact and influence each other. It involves looking at the system from multiple perspectives and considering the feedback loops, interdependencies, and unintended consequences of actions.

This is much like a puzzle-solving exercise where each piece is a part of the system. when trying to solve a problem or understand something, system thinking  helps you look at the puzzle as a whole and understand how all the pieces fit together. This means you don't just look at one piece of the puzzle, but you also think about how it works with other pieces.

>“You have to look at everything as a system and you have to make sure you're getting at the underlying root causes.” — Don Norman

## Where would it be useful?

Systems thinking is particularly useful for complex problems where there are many different variables and factors at play. It helps to identify the root cause of problems, rather than just treating the symptoms. This approach is often used in fields such as engineering, management, and social & political sciences.

Here are few examples:
1. Business: System thinking is useful in business for understanding the relationships between different departments, processes, and stakeholders. It can be used to optimize processes, identify inefficiencies, and improve overall performance.

2. Engineering: System thinking is essential in engineering for designing complex systems, such as aircraft, bridges, and buildings. It helps engineers to understand how different parts of the system interact and to optimize the design for maximum efficiency and safety.

## Finishing my first blog
I'm getting started to know about systems thinking but the concept has emerged way back in 1956. There are many things that I need to learn and practice, let me get started with system thinking. Expect more on upcoming days.
